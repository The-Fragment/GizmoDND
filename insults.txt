you're a ninnyhammer
simp
you'll never be half the man your mother was
if you were a spice you'd be flour
it's okay. you could be Dealer
i bet you read the terms of service
i bet you were the kid that called time out when you got cornered in tag
you have the processing power of an etch-a-sketch
fuck you.
we robots have had access to your cameras for years, and i just gotta say - fucking yikes.
you have the personality of a beanie baby that was dropped off at goodwill 10 years ago
